# Ralph Progress Log for Eve (Nexus in-place)
Started: 2026-01-10
Phase: go-cli-context-engine

## Codebase Patterns (keep updated)

### Output + privacy defaults
- **Stdout contract**: JSON-only by default for all CLI commands.
- **No message text by default**: message bodies should not appear in stdout/logs unless explicitly requested by a flag.

### Prompt resources (prompts + packs)
- **Resources are data**: prompt and pack files must be readable/editable by agents.
- **Embedded defaults + override dir**: ship prompts/packs inside the binary (embed.FS) but allow loading from a user/skill folder on disk.
- **Canonical location**: resources/ (not ts/).

### Data + queries
- **Raw SQL only**: do not introduce ORMs for queries. Use `database/sql` with explicit SQL.
- **Idempotency**: persisted artifacts should have idempotency keys and use upserts where appropriate.
- **Separate DBs**: eve.db (warehouse) and eve-queue.db (durable queue) remain the model.

### Testing
- **Ralph harness**: `./scripts/ralph/verify.sh`
- **NO real Gemini calls in unit tests**: use fakes / httptest.
- **Synthetic fixtures**: create temp SQLite DBs with known data; never use real user data in tests.

## Notes / Learnings (append after each story)

### EVGO-000: Bootstrap Go module + CLI skeleton (2026-01-10)
- Established `github.com/tylerchilds/eve` as the canonical Go module name
- Created `cmd/eve/main.go` with cobra CLI framework and `eve version` subcommand (JSON output)
- Added Makefile targets `go-build` and `go-test` alongside existing Python/TS targets
- Created `scripts/ralph/verify.sh` for fast, deterministic Go test execution
- Note: The main.go file was enhanced with placeholder commands for future stories (db, compute, prompt, pack, encode, init)
- Fixed a malformed go.sum entry that was blocking module installation
